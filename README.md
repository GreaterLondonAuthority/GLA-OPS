The Open Project System (OPS) is a user-friendly online system which organisations can use to submit bids for funding.



The system is used to:



* Create and submit new bids for grant funding
* Assess and approve bids
* Monitor project progress (both internal GLA projects and those submitted by partners)
* Report on key milestones, outputs and risks
* Make payments and issue reclaims
* Monitor budgets, expenditure and forecasts
* Audit changes and record decisions
* Submit and approve recycled grant annual returns



Backend (Java) application code is in src/main/java under each appropriate MVN root



Backend (Java) test code is in src/test/java under each appropriate MVN root



User interface (JavaScript/Angular) code is in gla-ops-application/src/main/ui and gla-ops-application/src/main/gla-ui
