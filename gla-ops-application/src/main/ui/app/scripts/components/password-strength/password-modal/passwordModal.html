      It is always good advice to make passwords as long as possible. However, a good password can be 8 characters and a
      bad one can be 9.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want a secure password that is easy to remember try using a few random words strung together.
      e.g. Mice-hello-yacht-slow (by the way, this example wonâ€™t work and is just for guidance).
      A visual story involving them can help you remember these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traditional advice has been that we need to create passwords that are hard to remember but in doing so these are
      often still easy for computers and hackers to guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Latest advice is that we can be very secure using passwords that are easy to remember.
